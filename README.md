# DesignCTPB

This is the immature version of R package for designing clinical trial with potential biomarker effect. We implemented it with GPU computing and smoothing method. 

How to install in R:

devtools::install_github("ubcxzhang/DesignCTPB")

Notes:
1) This version is still under development. We are now working on testing the consistency with our original codes.
2) The documentation is also developing right now. And if readers need any documentation to test our package, please contact email: Yitao Lu: yitaolu@uvic.ca/ Belaid: bmoa@uvic.ca. But I hope you could wait untill the formal version is published, thanks for your waiting.
